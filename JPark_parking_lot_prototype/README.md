# JPark Parking Lot Prototype
A parking lot prototype developed using RapsberryPi Zero to support parking lot reservation.

## About the project
A connection will be established to the JPark web server through Socket.IO to send and receive data. The parking lot prototype will switch on the barrier whenever the parking space is reserved, and can only be unlocked by the user who reserved it through JPark mobile application.
